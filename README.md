# python-bcubed

Simple extended BCubed implementation in Python for (non-)overlapping clustering evaluation. The implemented algorithm is described in detail in [1].

## Installation

You can simply use ```pip``` (or any similar package manager) for installation:

```shell
$ pip install bcubed
```

or, if you prefer a local user installation:

```shell
$ pip install --user bcubed
```

## Usage

To evaluate any clustering output you will need **ground-truth data** (also called gold-standard data). We call this the ```ldict```. The ground-truth is represented in a dictionary where the keys are items in the gold-standard and the values are sets of annotated categories for those items. For example:

```python
ldict = {
    "item1": set(["gray", "black"]),
    "item2": set(["gray", "black"]),
    "item3": set(["gray"]),
    "item4": set(["black"]),
    "item5": set(["black"]),
    "item6": set(["dashed"]),
    "item7": set(["dashed"]),
}
```

In the above example, ```item1``` is assigned two categories in the ground-truth: ```gray``` and ```black```. For the case of ```item6``` and ```item7```, both are assigned the single annotation ```dashed```. This representation supports modelling overlapping and non-overlapping ground-truth data.

The **clustering output** to be evaluated is called the ```cdict``` and is also represented as a dictionary in the same way as the ```ldict```. In this case, the keys are items in the clustering output and the values are the sets of assigned clusters for those items. For example:

```python
cdict = {
    "item1": set(["A", "B"]),
    "item2": set(["A", "B"]),
    "item3": set(["A"]),
    "item4": set(["B"]),
    "item5": set(["B"]),
    "item6": set(["C"]),
    "item7": set(["C"]),
}
```

Please note that the clusters names (or IDs) **do not need** to be the same as in the ground-truth data because the algorithm only considers the groupings, it does not try to match the names of clusters to the ground-truth categories.

Once you have defined the ```ldict``` (ground-truth data) and the ```cdict``` (clustering output to evaluate), you can simply do the following to obtain the extended BCubed precision and recall metric values:

```python
import bcubed

precision = bcubed.precision(cdict, ldict)
recall = bcubed.recall(cdict, ldict)
```

A more complete example can be found in the included ```example.py``` file, where the examples of the source work in [1] are used.
